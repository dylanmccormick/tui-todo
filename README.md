# 16 Projects in 16 weeks. Project #1: TUI TODO

This is a little project to familiarize myself with bubbletea in golang. Want to start making more TUIs and gaining the skills to work on other projects that are terminal-based. 

Obviously this is quite simple. We want the ability to load a set of tasks from a file. Update/ delete that set of tasks. Then return them to the file. 

The goal is to do each of these projects in a week. So this is the first one. 

MVP:
user has a terminal based UI that can be navigated by using the keyboard (vim and arrow keys). This UI will allow the user to create, update, and delete tasks as well as change the state of a task (todo, done)

Extra Features:
- Deadlines for tasks with countdown timers
- Tasks by individual
- If time permits. We can turn this into a Kanban style board.
